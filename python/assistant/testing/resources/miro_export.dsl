An Addon is any service with an endpoint that can be called upon by an Assistant. This allows an Assistant to be configured with a combination of a custom system prompt (the initial instructions given to the model) and Addon(s). Assistants can handle simple tasks, like instructing the Large Language Model (LLM) to respond in a specific language tone or style, as well as more complex scenarios, such as limiting the LLM''s data scope to a certain geographical location. This functionality is very similar to OpenAI GPTs and typically requires minimal or even zero development.
