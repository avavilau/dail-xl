description: Extract unique array entries using lambdas to determine uniqueness.
signature: 'array<T>.uniqueBy((element: T) => primitive, ...) => array<T>'
manual: >-
  `uniqueBy` creates new array with unique values of original array. To determine uniqueness, provided lambdas are used.
  Variadic number of lambdas can be passed. Uniqueness will be determined by tuples of lambda results.
  When there are several elements producing the same uniqueness values, the first one will be returned.
