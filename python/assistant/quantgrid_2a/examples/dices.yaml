        Find the average value of the sum of points when throwing two dices,
        provided that the second dice always shows less or equal than the first.

        I am planning to create a table with two unnested columns (one column for every dice) 
        to simulate all satisfying dice combinations,
        as for every value on first dice, several values from the second dice should be present in the table.
        
        Later, I could use that table to count sum for every combination and find its mean.
        
        First column may be generated using explicit array syntax (`{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}`). 
        However, there is a special condition for second column values, so I'll examine, whether QuantGrid functions can help me.

        Looks like I can use "range" function to generate numbers from 1 to first dice value.
        I need the "range" function documentation first to understand function signature and ensure correct type usage.
      tool:
        name: function_documentation
        args:
          function_names: [ range ]

        As expected, I can define upper bound to generate integer sequence. I'll use "range" function to generate second
        unnested column and satisfy requested condition.
        
        I will create two unnested columns, representing dice rolls,
        and will parametrize second column by first column cells for usage in "range" function.

        Now I need to create first unnested column for first dice results. I'll initialize new table by this column.
      tool:
        name: new_column
        args:
          table_name: Dices
          column_name: First
          cell_formula: '{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }'
          parametrize_by: [ ]
          unnest: true
          create_table: true
          expected_cell_type: 'number'

        OK. Column First has been created. Data type in every cell: number.

        Now the second constrained column.
        I'll just pass value of first dice as upper bound to RANGE function and unnest the result.
        Such way, table will contain all requested combinations.
      tool:
        name: new_column
        args:
          table_name: Dices
          column_name: Second
          cell_formula: 'range(First)'
          parametrize_by: [ First ]
          unnest: true
          create_table: false
          expected_cell_type: 'number'

        Great, now I have all info to actually find requested sum and mean.
        
        I can calculate mean of point sum using one calculate formula, but for clarity,
        I'll create regular column in Dices, that will contain sum of dice points for every combination.
      tool:
        name: new_column
        args:
          table_name: Dices
          column_name: Sum
          cell_formula: 'First + Second'
          parameterize_by: [ First, Second ]
          create_table: false
          expected_cell_type: 'number'

        As expected, resulting column contains integers.
        
        "average" function was listed in QuantGrid documentation, 
        so I'll request additional documentation to ensure correct usage.

        name: function_documentation
        args:

        Good! Now I have all info I need to solve user task.
        
        One option I have is to just create additional regular column in Dices table,
        but such way all column cells will hold the same value, 
        as mean value do not depends on particular Dices cells (rather than on whole column).
        
        That is not very convenient for user, so I'll just create new table with one column of single cell.
      tool:
        name: new_column
        args:
          table_name: Dices Mean
          column_name: Mean
          cell_formula: 'average(Dices.Sum)'
          parameterize_by: [ First, Second ]
          create_table: true
          expected_cell_type: 'number'

        Table Dices Mean contains answer in its single cell.
