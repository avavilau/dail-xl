Here are the details of new programming language called DIAL XL.

```
table T1
  dim [source] = T0
  [a] = [source][c]
  [b] = [source][d]
  [c] = 1
  [d] = "1"
  [e] = [a] + [b]
```

`table T1` defines new table of name T.
`dim [source] = T0` declares that field [source] of table T consists of all rows of table T0. That will make T to has the number of rows as T0
`[a] = [source][c]` dereferences field [c] from the row in [source]. It's repeated for every row
`[c] = 1` sets every row of field [c] to number 1.
`[d] = 1` sets every row of field [d] to text "1".
`[e] = [a] + [b]` makes [e] equal to row-by-row sum of [e]. Supported operators are *,/,-,<,>,=,<>,<=,>=,MOD,AND,OR. Please note that the AND operator has higher priority than OR. To alter this priority arrangement, use brackets. They are works the same way as in EXCEL. No other operators supported.

```
table T2
  [cnt] = COUNT(T)
  [sm] = SUM(T[a])
  [fst] = FIRST(T[c])
```
We created another table T2. It doesn't have `dim` field that means it will only has one row.
[cnt] is equal to count of rows in T, [sm] is total sum of all elements in T[a].
[fst] set to very first value of T[c] column. All functions in DIAL XL are upper case.
Other supported aggregations are: AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, LAST, MODE (that returns most frequent value). No other aggregations supported.
Remember, AVERAGE, SUM, MIN, MAX  are only applicable for numbers.
Remember, always use tables like this when you need calculate a single value (number or text)

```
table T3
  dim [r1] = RANGE(5)
  dim [r2] = RANGE(3)
  [sm] = SUM(T[a])
  [t] = TEXT([r1])
  [d] = DATE([r1], 1, [r2])
  [e] = DAY([d])
  [f] = SUM([r2])
```
Similarly we created table T3 with two dim fields, that will create table with 15 rows with every combination of [0,1,2,3,4] for T3[r1] and [0,1,2] for T[r2].
Next T3[sm] will be total sum of T[a] in every row. [t] will be text representation of [t1]. [d] will create create date using [r1] as a year and [r2] as day.
[e] will extract day out of [d].
Other supported simple functions are: MINUTE, SECOND, VALUE, IF, ISNA, IFNA, ABS they work similarly as in EXCEL.

Other functions that must be used to create table are:
```
table T4
  dim [s] = T3.SORTBY($[r1], -$[r2])
```
Creates table T4 with all rows of T4 sorted by [r1] and then [r2] descending due to - before it. "$" is used to refer to the table we sorting.
Remember you can only derefences field that explicitly defined in the table. You cannot dereference T4[sm] because it's not defined in T4, eventhough it was defined in its origin table T3.
```
table T5
  dim [s] = T3.UNIQUEBY($[r2])
```
Will leave only 3 rows with distinct values of r2. It takes first in case same values. "$" is used to refer to the table we selecting value from.
```
table T6
  dim [d1] = RANGE(5)
  dim [d2] = FILTER(T3, T3[r2] <= [d1])[r2]
```
[d2] for every value of [d1], will keep only rows of T3 that has [r2] that <= [d1]. 1+2+3+3+3, 12 rows in total. "$" is used to refer to the table we filtering.
And then it derefences [r2] from T3.
```
table T7
  dim [d1] = RANGE(5)
  [cnt] = COUNT(FILTER(T3, T3[r2] <= [d1]))
```
FILTER (as the functions above) can be used to return list to compute aggregations. This will generate 5 rows table with 1,2,3,3,3 in [cnt] field.

Please don't compare values with false or true. Example:
```
table T7
  dim [d1] = RANGE(5)
  [cnt] = COUNT(FILTER(T3, ISNA(T3[r2]) AND NOT ISNA(T3[r3])))
```

Please don't use `IN` function like `[a] IN ("A", "B", "C")`.

When you use operations like OR and AND in FILTER function you should use brackets to fix the priority:
```
table T8
  [value] = T7.FILTER((T7[d1] = 1 OR T7[d1] = 3) AND T7[cnt] = 4)
```

You can explicitly populate table data into table like this:
```
!manual()
table T9
  [color] = NA
  [size] = NA
override
  [color],[size]
  "red", 10
  "green", 5
  "blue", 15
```
Where `!manual()` means that this table rows are generated by entered data. Pay attention the override section must contain exactly same fields as defined in table. The override section can't contain DSL formulas.

Use " (double quotes) for strings if it's not table column name.

You can use FIND function like this with tables that have "key" fields:
```
!manual()
table T10
  key [name] = NA
  [size] = NA
override
  [name],[size]
  "James", "L"
  "Robert", "XL"
  "John", "S"

table T11
  dim [name] = T10[name]
  [size] = T10.FIND([name])[size]
```

You should generate a separate action to add the key field to the table If the table for search doesn't have the key field and you want to use the FIND function.

You can add comment/description into the field like this:
```
table T12
  # The comment to the field d1
  key [d1] = RANGE(10)
```

You can generate top 3 elements by price (3 items with lowest price) field of the table T13 like this:
```
!manual()
table T13
  [price] = NA
  [name] = NA
override
  [price],[name]
  20, "t-shirt"
  40, "shirt"
  100, "skirt"
  2000, "suit"
  500, "dress"

!layout(1, 4)
table Top3T13
  dim [source] = T13.SORTBY($[price]).FIRST(3)
  [price] = [source][price]
  [name] = [source][name]
```

There is a function that returns the names of the fields and called as: `Table1.FIELDS()`.

There's also CONTAINS(target, source) function.

Please don't use code like this `Table1[a] IN ("a", "b", "c")"` and use `(Table1[a] = "a" OR Table1[a] = "b" OR Table1[a] = "c")` instead.

No other list functions are supported.
